# Welcome to My Digital Journey üëã

Hey there! I'm Breydan, and this is where my passion for technology meets real-world impact. If you're curious about the intersection of enterprise-grade systems and cutting-edge AI development, you've found the right place.

## From Support Engineer to Full-Stack Builder

By day, I'm navigating the complexities of enterprise Java applications at One Empower, supporting multi-region banking systems that serve thousands of users. By night (and weekends), I'm crafting AI-powered SaaS applications that push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies.

This unique perspective‚Äîbridging enterprise reliability with indie innovation‚Äîshapes everything I build and share here.

### What Drives Me

**üöÄ Building Real Solutions**: Currently shipping [ReadSmart Today](https://www.readsmart.today), an AI-powered book summary platform that transforms how people consume knowledge.

**ü§ñ AI-First Development**: Exploring how tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI are revolutionizing the development workflow.

**üèóÔ∏è Modern Tech Stacks**: Mastering the art of choosing the right technologies for 2025 and beyond‚Äîfrom Next.js 15 to edge computing with Cloudflare.
