Google recently launched Gemini CLI, an open-source command-line interface tool based on the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, bringing artificial intelligence directly into the developer's terminal environment. This innovative tool represents a significant advancement in developer productivity, transforming the traditional command line from a rigid command executor into an intelligent conversational partner.

**Core Features and Architecture**

At the core of Gemini CLI is Gemini 2.5 Pro, a multimodal foundation model capable of handling a context window of up to 1 million tokens. This massive context window allows developers to input large codebases, documents, and file trees for comprehensive, multi-step analysis or transformation. The tool is equipped with several built-in features, including a code reader, a command runner, and a memory module. These features can be extended through Multimodal Composable Functions (MCPs), a Python-based interface for adding custom behaviors.

**Versatile Development Assistant**

While Gemini CLI excels at programming, it is designed as a versatile local utility for a wide range of tasks, from content generation and problem-solving to in-depth research and task management. The tool allows users to use natural language for prompts, eliminating the need to enter lengthy, complex commands or constantly consult documentation. Developers can perform complex tasks such as code refactoring, documentation generation, executing shell commands, running scripts, and editing files using natural language commands.

**Free Access and Usage Limits**

Any user with a personal Google account can access Gemini 1.5 Pro for free, with a limit of 60 requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day. This generous quota ensures that individual developers will rarely encounter usage limits in their development work. For professional developers who require higher limits or specific models, Google offers integration with Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, which use a usage-based billing model.

**Open Source and Extensibility**

The project is fully open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. This transparency allows developers to inspect the code, understand its functionality, and verify its security implications. The open-source nature encourages community contributions, including bug reports, feature suggestions, and code improvements. The tool supports built-in integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and bundled extensions, allowing developers to customize prompts and instructions for specific workflows.

**Development Ecosystem Integration**

Gemini CLI shares the same technology as Google's AI programming assistant, Gemini Code Assist. This integration provides consistency across different development environments, whether working in the terminal or in VS Code. The tool can use Google Search to ground prompts, fetch web pages, and provide the model with real-time external context.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**

Gemini CLI is written in TypeScript and runs on all platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Installation via npm is straightforward, making it easily accessible to developers regardless of their operating system.

Gemini CLI represents a paradigm shift in developer tools, making artificial intelligence an integral part of the command-line experience, enhancing productivity while maintaining the efficiency and portability that developers value.

## Basic Operations

*   **Add Context**: Use `@` to specify a file as context (e.g., `@src/myFile.ts`) to target a specific file or folder.
*   **Shell Mode**: Execute shell commands with `!` (e.g., `!npm run start`) or use natural language (e.g., "start the server").

## Command List

*   `/bug` - Submit a bug report.
*   `/chat` - Manage conversation history. Usage: `/chat <list | save | resume> [label]`
*   `/quit` - Exit the command-line interface.
*   `/compress` - Compress the context by replacing it with a summary.
*   `!` - Shell command.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-proj-",

# AutoGen AI Agent Development Project

## Project Overview
Develop an AI agent using the latest version of AutoGen 0.4, Python 3.11, and a venv virtual environment.

## Environment Configuration

### Python Environment
- Python Version: 3.11
- Virtual Environment: Use venv
- Package Management: pip + requirements.txt

### Installation Steps

# Create a virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install AutoGen
pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"

## Programming Standards

### Import Conventions

import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

### Code Style
- Use async/await for all operations (AutoGen 0.4 is an asynchronous architecture).
- Use type hints.
- Add Chinese comments to functions and classes.
- Ensure comprehensive error handling.

### Basic Pattern

async def main():
    # Create a model client
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
    
    # Create an agent
    agent = AssistantAgent("Assistant", model_client=model_client)
    
    # Run a task
    result = await agent.run(task="Your task")
    
    # Close the connection
    await model_client.close()

## Project Structure

project_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/           # Virtual environment (not committed to git)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env             # Environment variables (not committed to git)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py          # Main program entry point
â””â”€â”€ GEMINI.md        # This configuration file

## Environment Variable Setup

# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o

## Development Points

### Agent Types
- **AssistantAgent**: LLM-driven assistant agent.
- **CodeExecutorAgent**: Code execution agent.

### Team Modes
- **RoundRobinGroupChat**: Round-robin group chat.
- Supports multi-agent collaboration.

### Best Practices
- Test agents individually before combining them into a team.
- Use async/await for all operations.
- Properly close model client connections.
- Manage sensitive information with environment variables.
- Do not commit the virtual environment to version control.

## Documentation and Resource Acquisition

### MCP Server Configuration
Always use the **context7 MCP server** to search for the latest AutoGen documentation and code standards:
- Prioritize querying the official AutoGen 0.4 documentation.
- Get the latest API references and best practices.
- Find code examples and patterns.
- Verify version compatibility and new features.

### Search Strategy
When you need information about AutoGen:
1. First, use context7 to search the official documentation.
2. Focus on the changes and new features of version 0.4.
3. Get the latest examples of asynchronous programming patterns.
4. Look for best practices in multi-agent collaboration.

## Notes
- AutoGen 0.4 is completely different from version 0.2 and uses a new asynchronous architecture.
- AgentChat is suitable for rapid prototype development.
- Requires Python 3.11.
- All example code uses Chinese comments.
- When encountering problems, prioritize searching for the latest solutions via context7.
