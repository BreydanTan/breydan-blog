## Overview

![Claude Code Next js Cladflare s3](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-southeast-1-733447040549.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/claudecode.png)

This guide shows how I used Claude Code to migrate my Next.js blog from Vercel to Cloudflare Workers and set up AWS S3 for image storage. The result: better performance and lower costs.

## Why Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI coding assistant that goes beyond simple code completion. It helps with:

- **System architecture** - Understands your entire tech stack
- **End-to-end development** - From setup to deployment
- **Real-time problem solving** - Fixes issues in context
- **Multi-technology integration** - Works with various tools

## The Challenge

I wanted to migrate from Vercel to Cloudflare Workers for better control and lower costs. The main challenges were:

1. Making Next.js work with Cloudflare Workers
2. Setting up the build pipeline
3. Moving from Vercel's image optimization to S3
4. Keeping fast loading times

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Planning

Claude Code analyzed my existing setup and recommended using static export instead of full SSR. This would be simpler to deploy and faster to load.

### Step 2: Cloudflare Configuration

**OpenNext.js Config:**
```typescript
// open-next.config.ts
import type { OpenNextConfig } from '@opennextjs/cloudflare';

const config: OpenNextConfig = {
  default: {
    override: {
      wrapper: "cloudflare-node",
      converter: "edge",
      proxyExternalRequest: "fetch",
      incrementalCache: "dummy",
      tagCache: "dummy",
      queue: "dummy",
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

**Wrangler Config:**
```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "nextjs-blog-template"
compatibility_date = "2024-12-18"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
pages_build_output_dir = "out"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "9cec3a566ea44544b2fc60ab9553d93c"

[env.production]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### Step 3: Next.js Setup

**Next.js Config:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';
import createMDX from '@next/mdx';

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

**Sitemap Generation:**
```typescript
// src/app/sitemap.ts
import type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'

export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  return [
    {
      url: 'https://your-domain.com',
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'daily',
      priority: 1,
    },
    {
      url: 'https://your-domain.com/blog',
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'daily',
      priority: 0.9,
    },
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: S3 Image Storage

**Image Sync Script:**
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sync-images": "aws s3 sync public/images s3://your-bucket-name/blog --delete --acl public-read",
    "deploy": "npm run build && wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=nextjs-blog-template"
  }
}
```

**Image Organization:**
```
public/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post-name/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.png
â”œâ”€â”€ author/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ avatar.png
â””â”€â”€ icons/
    â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
```

**Using Images in Posts:**
```markdown
![Description](https://your-bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/blog/blog/post-name/image.png)
```

### Step 5: Deployment

**Simple Deployment Process:**
```bash
npm run generate-sitemap  # Create sitemap
npm run sync-images       # Upload images to S3
npm run deploy           # Deploy to Cloudflare
```

### Step 6: Performance Optimization with Claude Code

**Font Optimization:**
Claude Code identified that the original template was using Chinese fonts which weren't optimized for English content. We migrated to Inter font which loads faster and displays better for English text.

**JavaScript Optimization:**
To improve the Lighthouse Best Practices score, Claude Code helped implement several JavaScript optimizations including console log removal in production builds, enhanced webpack minification settings, and bundle size optimization.

**Build Pipeline:**
The build process was streamlined to generate static files, sync images to S3, and deploy to Cloudflare Pages in a single command.

## Results

### Performance Improvements
- **Global CDN** - Fast loading worldwide through Cloudflare's network
- **Static pages** - Instant page loads with pre-rendered HTML
- **Optimized images** - Proper caching from S3 with CDN delivery
- **JavaScript optimization** - Smaller bundle sizes and faster execution
- **Font optimization** - Better loading performance with web-optimized fonts

### Cost Savings
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Free hosting for most traffic levels
- **S3 Storage** - Pay only for actual storage and bandwidth used
- **No server costs** - Static generation eliminates compute costs

### Better Developer Experience
- **Auto deployment** - Git push triggers automatic builds
- **Easy image management** - Simple command-line upload workflow
- **Preview deployments** - Automatic preview URLs for pull requests

## Best Practices

### 1. Analyze First
Use Claude Code to understand your current setup before making changes. This prevents mistakes and helps choose the right approach.

### 2. Migrate Step by Step
Don't change everything at once. Test each part before moving to the next.

### 3. Use Static Generation
For blogs and content sites, static generation is often better than server-side rendering. It's faster and easier to deploy.

### 4. Optimize Performance Systematically
Claude Code helped identify specific performance bottlenecks like font choices and JavaScript bundle sizes, then provided targeted solutions.

### 5. Monitor Performance
Use Cloudflare's analytics and Lighthouse scores to track performance and find areas to improve.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Domain Setup
Setting up a custom domain involves adding it in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard and following the DNS configuration instructions.

### SEO Benefits
The setup provides automatic sitemap generation, fast loading that improves search rankings, pre-rendered HTML for better crawling, and optimized meta tags.

### Performance Monitoring
Cloudflare provides Core Web Vitals tracking, real-time metrics, geographic performance data, and bandwidth usage statistics.

## How Claude Code Made the Difference

### Problem Identification
Claude Code quickly identified performance issues like inappropriate font choices and unoptimized JavaScript bundles that I might have missed.

### Solution Implementation
Rather than just suggesting changes, Claude Code helped implement the actual fixes, from webpack configuration to font loading optimization.

### Testing and Validation
Claude Code guided the testing process, ensuring each optimization actually improved performance without breaking functionality.

### Knowledge Transfer
Throughout the process, Claude Code explained the reasoning behind each decision, helping me understand not just what to do but why.

## Future Improvements

Planning to add:
1. **Comment system** - User interactions and engagement
2. **Better caching** - Advanced caching strategies for even faster loading
3. **CMS integration** - Headless content management for easier writing
4. **Analytics** - Detailed visitor tracking and insights

## Final Architecture

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with static export

**Development Workflow:**
1. Write content in markdown format
2. Add images to organized folders
3. Sync images to S3 with single command
4. Reference S3 URLs in blog posts
5. Deploy with automated build process
6. Monitor performance via Cloudflare Analytics

## Conclusion

Using Claude Code made this complex migration manageable and educational. It provided architectural guidance, helped solve technical problems, and explained the reasoning behind each decision.

The result is a faster, cheaper, and more maintainable blog. Claude Code demonstrates how AI can amplify human capabilities rather than replace them, making complex projects achievable while teaching valuable skills along the way.

Most importantly, Claude Code didn't just help with the migration - it helped optimize performance through systematic identification of bottlenecks and implementation of targeted solutions. The combination of strategic thinking and hands-on implementation support made the entire process smooth and successful.
